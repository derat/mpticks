    <p class="disclaimer">
      This extension is unaffiliated with Mountain Project.
    </p>

    <div id="screen-1">
      <p>
        This extension loads your ticks from
        <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/" target="_blank">
          Mountain Project
        </a>
        and deletes all but the "best" tick for each route. "Best" is determined
        by comparing ticks' numbers of pitches, then their styles, and then
        their dates.
      </p>

      <p>
        For example, if you led a route several times but fell (entering a style
        of "Lead" and a lead style of "Fell/Hung") and later redpointed the
        route ("Lead" and "Redpoint"), then the "Fell/Hung" ticks will be
        deleted and the "Redpoint" tick preserved.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you onsighted a route ("Lead" and "Onsight") and later repeated it
        several times ("Lead" with an empty lead style), then the ticks with an
        empty lead style will be deleted and the "Onsight" tick preserved.
      </p>

      <p>
        When you click the "Load ticks" button below, this extension will use
        the
        <a href="https://www.mountainproject.com/data" target="_blank">
          Mountain Project Data API
        </a>
        to load all of your ticks and then display them in this popup. You'll be
        able to review the proposed changes before any ticks are deleted.
      </p>

        There's no way to undelete ticks, so make sure you've backed them up
        somewhere before you click this button. You can import ticks into
        <a href="https://mpticks.web.app/" target="_blank">mpticks</a>, or
        export them in CSV format from your Ticks page on Mountain Project.
